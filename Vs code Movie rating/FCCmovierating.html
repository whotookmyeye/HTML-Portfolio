        <p>John Wick had already lost everything that mattered — his beloved wife taken by a terminal illness. But in her final act of love, she left him a small beacon of hope: a puppy, a gift to help him find peace. That peace was shattered when the son of a powerful Russian mob boss broke into his life, stealing his prized 1969 Mustang and mercilessly killing the last gift from his wife. What they didn’t know — what they never could’ve imagined — was that John Wick isn’t just a man in mourning. He’s a legend of the underworld… and they just gave him a reason to come back.</p>
