<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal page! Here, you can find information about my background, interests, and the projects I'm currently working on.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I’m an aspiring software developer with a passion for creating websites and applications that let my creative side shine. Although I hold a Bachelor of Science in Criminology and had no prior background in programming, I’ve been actively learning web development through online courses and personal projects.</p>
<p>I'm currently learning web development to not only grow as a person, but also to build a meaningful career. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, eventually move into a senior developer role, and later take on a managerial position. I’m motivated by the opportunity to find a high-paying job that offers long-term career growth, so I can provide a comfortable life for my family. I’m also open to branching into other programming fields that can support my professional journey.</p>
