    <h1>Pork Adobo</h1>
    <p>Pork adobo is a Filipino favorite—tender chunks of pork simmered in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and bay leaves until rich and flavorful. It’s hearty, comforting, and best enjoyed with a heap of steamed rice. Every bite tastes like home.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix pork, soy sauce, garlic, and peppercorns. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes—or overnight if you’ve got the time.</li>
        <li>Heat a bit of oil in a pot. Take the pork out of the marinade (save that marinade!) and brown the pieces on all sides for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Pour in the marinade, add vinegar, bay leaves, and water. Don’t stir right away—let the vinegar cook for a few minutes to mellow out.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat, add the hard boiled eggs, cover, and simmer for about 40–50 minutes until the pork is tender and the sauce has reduced. Add brown sugar if you like it slightly sweet. Add siling labuyo for extra kick.</li>
        <li><a href="PorkAdobo1.jpg" target="_blank">Serve it with hot rice and dig in. Maybe don’t make plans afterward—food coma incoming.</a></li>
